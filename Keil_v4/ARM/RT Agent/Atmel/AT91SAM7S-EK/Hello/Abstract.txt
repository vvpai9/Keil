The Hello project is a demo program for the AT91SAM7S64
using Atmel AT91SAM7S Microcontroller Board. This version
is an example of how to integrate the Real-Time Agent onto
this processor.

It prints text to the serial port, and to the Real-Time
Agent terminal window, and blinks LEDs according to the 
push buttons on the board:
 - pressing SW1 prints the debug messages and blinks LED1
 - holding down SW2 holds the main program 
   (except LED4 blinking) and lights LED2
 - pressing SW3 turns on LED3
 - pressing SW4 turns off LED3
 - LED4 blinks at 1Hz rate

The example shows:
 - how to integrate the Real-Time Agent
 - how to setup the Advanced Interrupt Controller (AIC)
 - how to setup Interrupt Priority and Interrupt nesting
 - how to setup Periodic Interval Timer (PIT)
 - how to use the UART Interface
 - how to use the Parallel I/O (PIO) Controller

The Hello program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  AT91SAM7S Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
