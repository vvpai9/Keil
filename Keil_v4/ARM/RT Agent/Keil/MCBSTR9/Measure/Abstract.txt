The MEASURE program uses analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger.

You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of S2, S3 Buttons
on MCBSTR9 evaluation board. The required jumper setting are described below.

The program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:  runs in software Simulator
              ADC0 simulated using a debug function.
  MCBSTR9:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              COM1, 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity 
              Buttons S2, S3 (GPIO7) are sampled
              potentiometer POT1 is sampled as ADC0	(J4 = on)

The measure is precompiled for target Simulator and target MCBSTR9.
