The MEASURE program uses analog and digital inputs to
simulate a datalogger.

You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of
the S2 switch on MCB21xx evaluation boards. The required jumper 
settings are described below.

This version includes the Real-Time Agent, which provides
real-time target information. In this example it provides 
serial terminal emulation, and memory and watch information 
while the target is executing.

The MEASURE example program is available for several targets:

MCB2100:   Keil MCB2100 evaluation board with ULINK2 debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
           - Switch S2 (INT1) is used as GPIO and sampled
             (jumper positions: J1= off, J7= on)
           - potentiometer POT1 is sampled as AIN0
             (jumper position: J2= on)
           - serial port is provided via the Real-Time Agent

MCB2130:   Keil MCB2130/40 evaluation board with ULINK2 debugger
MCB2140:   - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
           - Switch S2 (INT1) is used as GPIO and sampled
             (jumper positions: J1= off, J7= on)
           - potentiometer POT1 is sampled as AIN1
             (jumper position: J2= on)
           - serial port is provided via the Real-Time Agent
