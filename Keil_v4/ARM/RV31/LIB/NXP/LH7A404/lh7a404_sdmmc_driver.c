 *
 * Project: LH7A404 SDMMC driver
 *
 * Description:
 *     This file contains driver support for the SDMMC module on the
 *     LH7A404
 *
 * Notes:
 *     This driver supports basic MMC and SD data transfer capability
 *     and is intended to be a reference on how the SDMMC interface of
 *     the LH7A404 works. This driver can be used to transfer data to
 *     and from an SDMMC card, but not every SDMMC function is
 *     implemented and a system with an SD/MMC interface may require
 *     more capability than what this driver provides. The following is
 *     provided by this driver:
 *         Non-blocking SDMMC state management
 *         SDMMC single (interrupt) and multi-block (DMA) read and write
 *         Interrupt and DMA control and transfer modes
 *         Device status and detection (via OCR polling)
 *    Presently, this driver doesn't support more than 1 card, although
 *    the controller itself can support stacked cards. Multi-sector
 *    reads and writes require DMA to operate properly - multi-sector
 *    reads and writes are not supported in interrupt mode.
 *
 *    This driver performs state management in the interrupt handler.
 *    Some IOCTL commands that request data or status from the MMC card
 *    return to the caller without the data being available at that
 *    time. The caller can either poll the state of the SDMMC driver to
 *    determine when the command is complete, or can use the driver
 *    callback function to implement a signalling method to notify the
 *    caller when the driver has completed the request. An exception
 *    to a OK/FAIL status is the read and write commands when using DMA.
 *    Using a read/write command with DMA will return a status after
 *    the first sector is complete, but the DMA interrupt must be used
 *    to monitor the transfer completion.
 *
 *    A typical sequence for starting a transferring data on the SDMMC
 *    interface is as follows:
 *        Open the MMC driver and get the MMC driver handle
 *        Issue an IOCTL "MMC_RESET" command and wait for about 500mS
 *        Issue an IOCTL "MMC_DETECT" command
 *        Keep querying the interface for the current status
 *        If the status is an error, then a card was not installed or
 *            a detection error occurred
 *        Issue a read or write command
 *        Keep querying the interface for the current status
 *        Once the status shows complete, the data is either ready to
 *            process or has been written to the card
 *        Deselect the card
 *
 *    This driver requires interrupts and optionally DMA! The interrupt
 *    and DMA controllers must be initialized and enabled for the SDMMC
 *    outside of this driver. This driver does handle interrupt and DMA
 *    logic specific to the SDMMC interface. If only the interrupt mode
 *    is used, sector transfers will only occur one at a time.
 *
 *    The initialization command and the read/write commands when used
 *    with DMA will not call the user callback upon completion. This is
 *    by design.
