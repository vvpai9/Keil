Example description
===================
Program using the ADC peripheral triggered through the external Pin to start the
conversion.
TIM0 is configured to generate the external trigger signal and injected to pin P4.7.
TIM1 is configured to generate a PWM signal to be the input for the ADC channel6, 
The frequency of this signal is the half of the external trigger’s frequency.
When 16 samples are transferred to internal SRAM (using the DMA capability) the ADC
is disabled.

for each external trigger's rising edge one sample is captured and transferred to 
internal SRAM "Dest_Buffer" through DMA.

Hardware environment
====================
 - Connect pin P4.7 to pin6.0 (on STR91x-EVAL board).
 - Connect pin P4.2 to pin4.6 (on STR91x-EVAL board).
 - Remove jumper JP1.
   

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 91x_adc.c
  + 91x_lib.c
  + 91x_tim.c
  + 91x_gpio.c
  + 91x_scu.c
  + 91x_vic.c
  + 91x_fmi.c
      
- Link all compiled files and load your image into Flash
- Run the example
