Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to set a communication between the two
SSPs and performs a transfer from Master to Slave and from Slave to Master in 
Motorola frame format.
SSP0 is configured as Master in Motorola frame format and with an 8bits data size 
to communicate with the Slave SSP1 configured in motorola frame format and with the
same data size as SSP0. 
In the first part, the Master send the SSP0_Buffer_Tx to be received by the Slave.
Then data read by the SSP1 peripheral and stored in the SSP1_Buffer_Rx is compared
with the expected values of transmitted buffer. The result of this comparison is 
stored in the "TransferStatus1" variable.
After the first transfer, the SSP0 receive FIFO have to be cleared by reading its 
eight data.
In the second part, The Slave send the SSP1_Buffer_Tx to be received by the Master
Then data read by the SSP0 peripheral and stored in the SSP0_Buffer_Rx is compared 
with the expected values of transmitted buffer. The result of this comparison is 
stored in the "TransferStatus2" variable.

Hardware environment
====================
Connect both SSP0 and SSP1 pins as following:
 - Connect SSP0_SCLK(P2.4) to SSP1_SCLK(P3.4).
 - Connect SSP0_MISO(P2.6) to SSP1_MISO(P3.5).
 - Connect SSP0_MOSI(P2.5) to SSP1_MOSI(P3.6).
 - Connect SSP0_nSS (P2.7) to VCC via pull-up.
 - Connect SSP1_nSS (P3.7) to GND via pull-down.

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 91x_lib.c
  + 91x_ssp.c
  + 91x_gpio.c
  + 91x_scu.c
  + 91x_fmi.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into Flash
- Run the example
