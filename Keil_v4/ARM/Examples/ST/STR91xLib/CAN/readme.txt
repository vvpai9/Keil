Example description
===================
This example provides a short description of how to use the CAN peripheral and
gives a configuration sequence. In this example, standard ID and extended ID frames 
are sent and received in loopback + silent modes. The standard ID frame is sent at a
1 Megabyte standard baud rate and received by polling. The extended ID frame is sent
at a 100 kilobyte standard baud rate and received with the CAN IRQ handler.
