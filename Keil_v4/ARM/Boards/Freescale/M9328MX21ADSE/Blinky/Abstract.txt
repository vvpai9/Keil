The Blinky project is an simple example program for the  
Freescale 'MC9328MX21' microcontroller using Freescale 
'M9328MX21ADSE' (Application Development System) Board.

Example functionality:
 - 2 LEDs blink (LED3, LED4)

Clocks:   XTAL                  =  32.768 kHz 
          MPLL                  = 266.000 MHz 
          SPLL                  = 288.000 MHz 
          FCLK (CPU) = MPLL     = 266.000 MHz
          HCLK       = MPLL / 2 = 133.000 MHz
          NFCCLK     = MPLL / 8 =  33.250 MHz
Memories: 64MB SDRAM
          32MB NOR Flash
          64MB NAND Flash (small additional daughter board)

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  i.MX21 Int RAM: configured for on-chip RAM
                  (may be used for target debugging)
  i.MX21 Ext NOR: configured for external NOR flash
                  (may be used for target debugging or 
                  production)
