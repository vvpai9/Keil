The Blinky project is a simple program for the NXP 'LH7A404' 
microcontroller using NXP 'SDK-LH7A404-11' evaluation board 
and demonstrating interrupt functionality and using library 
functions.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                     =  14.7456 MHz
   - PLL (GCLK)               = 199.9872 MHz
   - FCLK  = GCLK             = 199.9872 MHz
   - HCLK  = FCLK / 2         =  99.9936 MHz
   - PCLK  = HCLK / 2         =  49.9968 MHz
 - 2 status LEDs blink (STATUS0, STATUS1) with speed 
   of 1 second, determined by Timer0 working in 
   interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  LH7A404 Int RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                         (may be used for target debugging)
  LH7A404 Ext NOR Flash: runs from External NOR Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
  LH7A404 Ext SDRAM:     configured for external SDRAM, 
                         (may be used for target debugging)

Notes:
  - on jumper J6 jump pins 1-3 and 4-6
  - MMU is initialized in startup so that all memory areas are 
    mapped to their original addresses, Internal RAM or External 
    SDRAM is mapped to address 0 according to settings and VIC1 is 
    mapped to address 0xFFFFF000 in adition to its original address.
