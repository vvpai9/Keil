The ExtMem project is a simple memory test program for the STR912FW44
using Star9 Evaluation Board with external Memory and external Flash.
The used memory test is published by Michael Barr.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - ExtMem programm runs a memory test for the external memory
   on the Star9 Board.

   external RAM:   0x38000000 - 0x380FFFFF
   external Flash: 0x3C000000 - 0x3C7FFFFF

   Red LED:    memory tests for external RAM failed.
   Yellow LED: memory tests for external RAM successful

The ExtMem program is available for target:

  Star9 IntFlash: runs from internal Flash located on chip

  Star9 ExtFlash: runs from external Flash located on board
                  (start ExtMem in a Debug session)
