The Hello project is a very simple program that prints
"Hello World" to the serial port and toggles some LEDs
on the Sharp LH75401 using the Logic Zoom LH75401 Board.

The example shows:
 - how to setup the Static Memory Controller
 - how to setup the Vector Interrupt Controller
 - how to setup Timer for periodic interrupts
 - how to use the UART
 - how to change the port

The Hello program is available in different targets:
  Zoom LH75401 Flash: configured for off-chip Flash
    (used for production or target debugging)
  Zoom LH75401 RAM:   configured for on-chip Local SRAM
    (may be used for target debugging)
