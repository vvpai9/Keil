The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Cortex-M3 on 'Actel A2F200' FPGA using 'Actel FUSION2 
DEVELOPMENT BOARD' and is compliant to the Cortex 
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL   =  50 MHz
 - SYSCLK = 100 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example drives one LED D4.

The Blinky program is available in target:
  A2FM3F:      - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
