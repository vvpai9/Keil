The Blinky project is an simple example program for 
the LPC3180 using PHYTEC 'PCM-976' with 'PCM-03' Board.

Example functionality:
 - 4 LEDs blink (D305, D306, D309, D310)

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  LPC3180 Int RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                     (may be used for target debugging)
  LPC3180 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM 
                     (may be used for target debugging
                      or production)

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
       (from Keil) to NAND Flash 
    2. Download application built for 'Ext SDRAM' 
       target to NAND Flash
