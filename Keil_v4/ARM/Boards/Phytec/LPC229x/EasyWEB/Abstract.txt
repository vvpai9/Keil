This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
extra issue 'Embedded Internet'.  It can be downloaded from the 
following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft.

This software was adapted to work with a Phytec phyCore LPC229x board 
and the Keil RV ARM C-Compiler with as less modifications as possible. 

Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.

The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
This tiny webserver needs very less resources and therefore has
some restrictions:
- only one active TCP session at the time
- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
It is only available in German language. 

The easyWEB project is set up for two targets:
  phyCore LPC229x - Flash:  Settings for Phytec LPC229x Board. 
                            Program code is loaded into off-chip flash

  phyCore LPC229x - XRAM:   Settings for Phytec LPC229x Board.
                            Program code is loaded into off-chip ram, 
                            for unlimited number of breakpoints.


*** NOTE ***

Due to a hardware restriction on the Phytec board, this example only 
works with 10MBit LAN connection. You may need to reduce the communication 
speed for the LAN adapter on your PC or remove the auto-negotiation from 
the LAN91C111.C source file.

On Windows XP 10MBit LAN connection may be configured under:

Local Area Connection - Properties - General -
Connect Using (select the net adapter) - Configure -
Advanced - Property - Speed & Duplex - 10Mbit Full.

*** END NOTE ***
