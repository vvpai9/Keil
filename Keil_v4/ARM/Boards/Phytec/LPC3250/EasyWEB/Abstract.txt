This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
extra issue 'Embedded Internet'. It can be downloaded from the 
following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft. 

This software was adapted to work with NXP LPC3250 using 
PHYTEC 'PCM-967' baseboard and 'PCM-1304.0' CPU board and 
the Keil MDK-ARM with as few modifications as possible. 

Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.

The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
some restrictions:
- only one active TCP session at any one time
- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
It is only available in German language. 

The easyWEB project is set up for one target:
  LPC3250:  configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
            external NOR flash

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level NOR bootloader
       ('bootloader_NOR' from Keil) to external NOR flash 
    2. Download the easyweb application to external NOR Flash
