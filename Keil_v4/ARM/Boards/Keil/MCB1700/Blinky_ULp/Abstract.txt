The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL  =  12 MHz
 - PLL0  = 384 MHz
 - CCLK  =  96 MHz

Example functionality:                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:                 configured for uVision Simulator

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
					         use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM" or "Cortex Debug" or "JTAG"

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
					         use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
					         use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
LPC17xx_TPIU.ini enables TPIU Interfcace. 
                 TPIU signals are available on the pins hosting them. 
Trace pins:  TRACECLK        P2.6
             TRACEDATA0..3   P2.5..P2.2    (4 bit trace data)
             do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
