The PWM project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM330'
using Keil 'MCBTMPM330' Evaluation Board, compliant to 
Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

It generates a PWM signal on N38 at a rate depending on AD potentiometer 
position. Button PH1 updates new cycle. Button NMI causes 
NMI Interrupt.


Core Speed:        40MHz

The PWM program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       runs in µVision Simulator
  TMPM330 Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  TMPM330 RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)
