The Blinky project is a simple program for the Toshiba 'TMPM330'
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMPM330' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL  =  10 MHz
 - CCLK  =  40 MHz

Example functionality:                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:                 configured for uVision Simulator

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "JTAG"

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "TRACE"

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
                             use connector "TRACE"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
TMPM330_TP.ini enables TPIU interface

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
