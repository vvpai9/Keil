The Blinky project is a simple program for the ST730FZ2T7
using 'HITEX STR730 EVALBOARD' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - analog conversion of value from potentiometer 
   (using internal A/D converter in interrupt mode)
 - diplay converted analog value in hexadecimal representation on 
   two 7 segment LED displays
   (using TIM4 PWM in interrupt mode for time multiplexing for display)
 - if key S2 is pressed make a frequency output on buzzer 
   (using TIM3 PWM in interrupt mode with frequency 
   corresponding to converted analog value)
 - output 'Measured analog value (10 bits) = ' with converted analog 
   value in decimal notation on UART0
   (9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) 
   

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:             configured for software Simulator
  STR730 Board - Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                         (used for production or target debugging)
