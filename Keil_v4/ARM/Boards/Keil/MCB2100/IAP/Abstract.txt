The IAP project shows how to use IAP function calls for In-Application
Programming of the on-chip Flash ROM.

At start of the program there is a delay loop for debugger synchronization.
For details refer to:
   http://www.keil.com/support/docs/2767.htm

This demo first programs some values into the Flash ROM and Erases then
the content of this Flash ROM.

The IAP program is available in different targets:
  MCB2100_V162:   runs on the MCB2100 Board with disabled PLL to bypass
                  the IAP.1 problem described in the Philips errata sheet
                  (runs on boot loader before V1.63)

  MCB2100_V163:   runs on the MCB2100 Board with enabled PLL

This program may be even tested in the uVision Simulator.
