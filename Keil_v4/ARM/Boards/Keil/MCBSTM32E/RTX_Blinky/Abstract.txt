This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  MCBSTM32E:   - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
