The HID project is a demo program for the STM32F103ZE 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32E' Evaluation Board.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 6 LEDs (PB8..PB13) 
  - 5 Push Buttons (Joystick)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTM32E: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper VUSB to PB14 for debugging
      LED PB14 can not be used!
