The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1343' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL        = 12 MHz
   - SYS Clock   =  1 MHz
 - 8 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  LPC1343 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)
  LPC1343 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
