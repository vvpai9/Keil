The HID project is a demo program for the LPC1343
using Keil MCB1000 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  72 MHz
   - USBPLL =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (PIO2.0..7)
  - 1 Push Button (BOOT)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCB1000: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)
