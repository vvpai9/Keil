The Memory project is a demo program for the LPC2478
using Embedded Artists boards:
  Daughter Board - 'LPC24xx OEM Board v1.1a'
  Mother   Board - 'OEM Base Board QVGA v1.1'

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED0: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - LED1: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - LED2: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - LED3: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2470: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J37 to Lower Pos (enable via P0.14)
