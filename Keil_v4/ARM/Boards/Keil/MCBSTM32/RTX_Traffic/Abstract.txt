Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing
button (S3) that lets pedestrians cross.  The lights 
are connected to Port B. You can see this in action using
uVision Debugger. 

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in Traffic. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  Serial I/O is interrupt and event driven.  Look at
   Serial.c for the complete, encapsulated module.
   USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Traffic program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  MCBSTM32:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
