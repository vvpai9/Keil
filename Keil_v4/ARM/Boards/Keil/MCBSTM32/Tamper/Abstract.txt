The 'Tamper' project is a simple program for the STM32F103RBT6 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of the Tamper detection.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - After startup BKP_DR1 and BKP_DR2 are set to specific values.
   Tamper pin is configured to generate an interrupt  
   led PB9 is lit if BKP_DR1, BKP_DR2 are cleared upon a tamper event
   led PB8 is lit if BKP_DR1, BKP_DR2 are not cleared 
 
The EXTI program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  MCBSTM32:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
