This Sound project demonstrates Sound generation with the 
Philips LPC2138 using Keil MCB2130 Microcontroller Board.

Push button INT1 is used to play the Sound again and the
Potenciometer is used for setting the Volume Level
(current Volume Level is shown via the LEDs).

The Sound program is available in different targets:
  Simulator: configured for software Simulator
  MCB2130:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM
             (used for production or target debugging)
