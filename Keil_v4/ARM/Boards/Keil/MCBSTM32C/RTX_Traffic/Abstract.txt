The 'RTX_Traffic' project is a demonstration program for the 
'STM32F107VCT6' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =               25.00 MHz
 - PLL3    = (XTAL/5)*10 = 50.00 MHz
 - PLL2    = (XTAL/5)* 8 = 40.00 MHz
 - PLL1    = (PLL2/5)* 9 = 72.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  = PLL1        = 72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK      = 72.00 MHz
 - PCLK1   = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz
 - PCLK2   = HCLK        = 72.00 MHz
 - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6     = 12.00 MHz
 - SYSTICK = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz

USART2 settings:
 - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Memories:
 - Internal Flash        - 256 kB (adr: 0x08000000)
 - Internal RAM          -  64 kB (adr: 0x20000000)

Example functionality:                                                   
Traffic is a RTX Kernel based program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a specific time 
period.  There is a pedestrial crossing button (User) that lets 
pedestrians cross.  The lights are connected to Port E. You can see 
this in action using uVision Debugger. 

There are several things of interest here:
 - This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization and operation code
   are in Traffic. Look for the init task to see where everything starts.

The Traffic program is available in different targets:
  MCBSTM32C:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
