This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

This example simulates step driver mode.

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  SAM9263 Int RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM (80kB+16kB)
                     (used for target debugging and production)
  SAM9263 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                     downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB)
                     (used for target debugging and production)

Notes: 
  - For "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM" target if Debug is selected 
    the code is loaded to External SDRAM and debugging happens there, 
    if Download to Flash Memory is selected the code downloads to 
    External DataFlash Card
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM"
    version to work as standalone. This is done by opening 
    Bootloader project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" 
    button.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. Select "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM" target in this project and
