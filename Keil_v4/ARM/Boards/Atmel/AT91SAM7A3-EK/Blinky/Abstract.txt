The Blinky project is a simple program for the AT91SAM7A3
using Atmel AT91SAM7A3-EK Microcontroller Board.

It blinks the 4 LEDs on the board. The board's joystick
can be used to control the blinking speed (up/down),
the direction (left/right) and to invert (push) the blinking.

                         (used for production or target debugging)
