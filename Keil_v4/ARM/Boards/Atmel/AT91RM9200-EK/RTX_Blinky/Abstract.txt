This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Three LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the three output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C

This example simulates step driver mode.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:  uVision Simulator for evaluation

AT91RM9200: Atmel AT91RM9200 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
            - Application is loaded to external Flash.

Notes: 
  - If "AT91RM9200" is used as target jumper J15 should be 
    in position EXT (pins 2-3)
