The Blinky project is an example program for the AT91RM9200
using Atmel AT91RM9200-EK Evaluation Board and demonstrating
interrupt usage.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 3 LEDs blink from left to right and back
 - time of LED switching is determined by Programmable Interrupt 
   Timer (PIT) working in interrupt mode

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  RM9200 Ext Flash:       configured for external Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  RM9200 Int RAM:         configured for on-chip RAM
                          (may be used for target debugging)
  RM9200 Ext SDRAM Debug: configured for external SDRAM
                          (may be used for target debugging)
  RM9200 Ext SDRAM:       configured for code to be in external Flash 
                          and copy itself to external SDRAM and run from 
                          there
                          (may be used for target debugging or 
                          production)

Warning !!! IF "RM9200 Ext Flash" or "RM92000 Ext SDRAM" ARE SELECTED 
            AS TARGET AND PROGRAM IS DOWNLOADED TO EXTERNAL FLASH 
            THE U-BOOT BOOTLOADER WILL BE OVERWRITTEN

Notes: 
  - If "RM9200 Ext Flash" and "RM9200 Ext SDRAM" are used as 
    target jumper J15 should be in position EXT (pins 2-3)
  - For "RM9200 Int RAM" or "RM9200 Ext SDRAM" targets jumper 
    position is irrelevant as those targets are used for debugging 
    and program is loaded to Internal RAM or External SDRAM using 
    debugger scripts (.ini file) and started
  - For "RM9200 Ext SDRAM" target the code can be built only if 
    licenced version of tools is used, because it uses custom Linker 
    script in file ROM_to_RAM.sct
