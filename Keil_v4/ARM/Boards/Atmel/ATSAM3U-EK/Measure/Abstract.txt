The MEASURE program uses analog and digital inputs to 
simulate a datalogger.

You may watch the value of analog input ADC0, ADC1 and the state 
of USR_LEFT, USR_RIGHT Buttons on SAM3U-EK evaluation board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

 - USART1 (COM1) settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity

 - ADC
   - ADC0 channel3 connected to PB4 
   - ADC1 channel0 connected to PB5 


The program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
                Serial Window #3
                ADC1 channel 1 simulated using a debug function.
  ATSAM3U-EK:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)
