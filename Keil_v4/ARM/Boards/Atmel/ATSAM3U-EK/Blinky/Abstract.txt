The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' 
microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.10).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed of 1 second, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode

The Blinky program is available for target:
  Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
  SAM3U Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                (used for production or target debugging)
