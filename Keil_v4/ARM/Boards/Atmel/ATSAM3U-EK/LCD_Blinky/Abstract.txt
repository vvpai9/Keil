The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the Atmel 'AT91SAM3U4E' 
microcontroller using Atmel 'ATSAM3U-EK' evaluation board and 
demonstrating interrupt functionality and display to graphic LCD.
(compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard 
(CMSIS v1.2))

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz
 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 
   150 ms
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed of 50 ms, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available for target:
  ATSAM3U-EK: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)

Notes: - In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as 
         this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation

Picture conversion procedure:
1. Convert picture to 16 BPP (R - 5bits, G - 6bits, B - 5bits)
2. Remove header from bmp by hex editor, remaining file size should 
   be equal to (width * height * 2) bytes
3. Convert prepared file without header to C array
