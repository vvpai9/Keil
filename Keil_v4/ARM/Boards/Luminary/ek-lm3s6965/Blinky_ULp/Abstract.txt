The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the TI 'LM3S6965' 
microcontroller using 'EK-LM3S6965-C' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL  =   8 MHz
 - PLL   = 400 MHz
 - CCLK  =  50 MHz

Example functionality:                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 1 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:           configured for uVision Simulator

  SWO Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                       shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
					   use connector "JTAG"


ULINKpro notes
--------------

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
