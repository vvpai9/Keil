The 2-nd level Bootloader for the NXP 'LPC31xx' 
(LPC313x, LPC314x and LPC315x) device series 
(configured for External SDRAM and loaded to 
External NAND Flash on the Embedded Artists 
LPC313x/4x/5x Board)

This is a 2-nd level bootloader for NXP LPC31xx 
(LPC313x, LPC314x and LPC315x) device series with 
External NAND Flash and External SDRAM. 
It downloads to BLOCK 1 (128 kB) of the NAND Flash.
The 1-st level bootloader that is in ROM of 
LPC31xx first downloads this 2-nd level 
bootloader to internal RAM and starts it.

The 2-nd level bootloader's main function is to 
copy user program from the External NAND Flash 
to the External SDRAM and start it.

Just select Flash -> Download to download it 
to the NAND Flash.

Note: - Bad block skipping is supported
      - If system is to be used with APEX please 
        run Full Chip Erase previously
      - For debugging please change boot 
        settings not to boot from NAND Flash
        (for example change jumper BOOT0 to high) 
        and reset the board manually
      - For NAND Flash booting jumpers BOOT0..2
        have to be set to GND and jumper DBUF_EN 
        has to be disconnected
