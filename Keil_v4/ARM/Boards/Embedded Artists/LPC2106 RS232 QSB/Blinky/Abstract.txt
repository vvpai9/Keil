The Blinky project is a simple program for the LPC2106
using 'Embedded Artists LPC2106 RS232 QuickStart Board v1.1' 
as dauhgter board and 'QuickStart Prototype Board v1.1' 
as mother board.

It blinks the LEDs at constant speed and prints current 
state on LED pins to the Serial Port 0 (115200 baud, 8 data 
bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in software Simulator
  LPC2106 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                  (used for target debugging) 
  LPC2106 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for final application version)

Notes: 
  - Remove jumpers J6 and J7 on daughter board
  - Fit jumpers J21 (JTAG on LPC2106) and jumper J18 (DBGSEL) 
    on the mother board
