This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

Jumper setting:
   Daughter board: remove J6, J7
   Mother   board: fit    JTAG

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
