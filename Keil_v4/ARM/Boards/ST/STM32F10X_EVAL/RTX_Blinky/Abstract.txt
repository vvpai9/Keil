This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

It simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.
In addition it also drives the Color LCD on the Eval Board
and displays the Keyboard states.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

STM32F10x: Evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           Application is loaded to internal Flash.
