The HID project is a demo program for ST STR9_DONGLE Board
using a STMicroelectronics STR91x Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs		   (LD81..LD84)
  - 4 Push Buttons (B85..B88)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  STR9 Dongle: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)
