The Blinky project is a simple program for the ST750FL2T6
using ST Microelectronics 'STR75x-EVAL' Evaluation Board 
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - TIM2 timer is activating LED and works in interrupt mode
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - text is displayed to graphical LCD
 - bargraph is displayed to graphical LCD, according to 
   potentiometer position
 - 4 LEDs state represent the potentiometer position
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  STR750 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  STR750 RAM:      runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (may be used for target debugging)
