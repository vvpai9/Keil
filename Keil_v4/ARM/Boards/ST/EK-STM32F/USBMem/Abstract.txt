The Memory project is a demo program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using STMicroelectronics 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - PC4: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - PC5: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - PC6: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - PC7: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  EK-STM32F: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)
