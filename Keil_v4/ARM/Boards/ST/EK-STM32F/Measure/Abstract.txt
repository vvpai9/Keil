The 'Measure' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using STMicroelectronics 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board. It uses 
analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger

You may watch the value of analog input VR1, the state of 
Key2, Key3 Buttons and the state of the joystick (Key4).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - USART1 settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity

 - ADC
   - ADC1 channel10 connected to potentiometer VR1 
 

The program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   configured for software Simulator
               Serial Window #1
               ADC1 channel 1 simulated using a debug function.
  EK-STM32F:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)
