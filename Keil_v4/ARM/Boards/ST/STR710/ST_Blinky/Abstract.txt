The Blinky project is a simple program for the ST710FZ2T6
using ST Microelectronics STR710 Evaluation Board.

It blinks the Bicolor (Red/Green) LED. Blinkig rate is doubled
while the SEL button is pressed. It also shows the Potenciometer
position via the 16 Red LEDs.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:           configured for software Simulator
  STR710 Board Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                       (used for production or target debugging)
  STR710 Board RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging) 
  STR710 Board ExtMem: runs from External Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)
