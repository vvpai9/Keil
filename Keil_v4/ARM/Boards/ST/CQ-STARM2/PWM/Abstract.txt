The 'PWM' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
and demonstrates the use of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) with Timer TIM3.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - HSI     =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           48.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 48.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 24.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 48.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 =  8.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  6.00 MHz

 - TIM3 is running at  100Hz.
   LED  is dimmed using the PWM function of TIM3 channel1
 
The Timer program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  CQ-STARM:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
