The HID project is a demo program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using CQ-STARM2 Board plugged to CQ-STARM BaseBoard.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs         (right 7 segment display)
  - 8 Push Buttons (SW1..SW8)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LED
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  CQ-STARM: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)
