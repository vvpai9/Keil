The 'RTC' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using CQ-STARM2, CQ-STARM BaseBoard and demonstrating 
the use of the Real Time Clock in interrupt mode.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - RTC is configured to generate an second interrupt
 - seconds 0..59 are displayed on the seven segment display.
 
The RTC program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  CQ-STARM:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
