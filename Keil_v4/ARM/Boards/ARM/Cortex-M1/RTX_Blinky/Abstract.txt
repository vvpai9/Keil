This is a simple RTX Kernel based Blinky example for
the Cortex-M1 using ARM Emulation Baseboard HBI-0140
and LT-XC2V6000 Logic Tile which emulates ARM Cortex-M1.

Example simulates the Traffic light which is timed and
lets cars pass during a specific time period and lets
pedestrians cross during other time period.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:  runs in µVision Simulator
  Emulator:   runs in Emulator
