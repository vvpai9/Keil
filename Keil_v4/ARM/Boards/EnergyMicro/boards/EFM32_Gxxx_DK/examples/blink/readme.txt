
This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS including
DVK BSP (board support package) and demonstrates 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode.

It sets up access to DVK registers, for use with 
MCU-Module's with and without LCD.

Board:  Energy Micro EFM32-Gxxx-DK Development Kit
Device: EFM32G290F128 and EFM32G890F128

-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SystemInit       called from startup_efm32.s
SystemCoreClock  is 14Mhz
SysTick          runs in interrupt mode
