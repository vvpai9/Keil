The 'Blinky' project is an simple example program for the  
Socle 'PC7230-QG' microcontroller using 
Socle 'PDK-PC7230 Ver.1.0' Evaluation Board. 

Example functionality:
 - 1 LED blinks in 1 second intervals
 - time of LED switching is determined by Timer (TIM1) 
   working in interrupt mode

Clocks:   XTAL                   =  12.0000 MHz
          CPLL                   = 133.0000 MHz
          UPLL                   =  88.4736 MHz
          AHB Clock = CPLL       = 133.0000 MHz

Memories: 64MB  SDRAM      (adr: 0x80000000-0x83FFFFFF)
          8MB   NOR Flash  (adr: 0x00000000-0x007FFFFF)
          128MB NAND Flash

Important !!! Hardware adjustment needed !!!
  Please remove resistor R15 and connect ARM_SRSTn line to  
  pin 3 of U6 chip. 

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  PC7230 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM
                    (may be used for target debugging)
  PC7230 Ext NOR:   configured for external NOR flash
                    (may be used for target debugging or 
                    production)
