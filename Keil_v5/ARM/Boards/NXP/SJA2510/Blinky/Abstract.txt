The Blinky project is a simple program for the 'SJA2510' 
microcontroller using NXP's 'SJA2510 Customer Demo Board'.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL           =  10 MHz
   - PLL            = 160 MHz
   - SYS  = PLL / 2 =  80 MHz
 - 6 LEDs blink from left to right and back
   (LEDs are connected to P1.24 .. P1.29)
 - speed of LED blinking can be changed by pressing 
   S1001 (decreased) or S1002 (increased) buttons
   (S1001 - P1.31; S1002 - P1.30)
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  SJA2510 Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
