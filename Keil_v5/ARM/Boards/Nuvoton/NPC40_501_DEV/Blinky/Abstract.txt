The Hello project is a simple demo program for Nuvoton 'NUC501BDN' 
microcontroller using Nuvoton NPC40_501_DEV Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL     =  12.0 MHz
   - PLL      = 288.0 MHz
   - HCLK     =  72.0 MHz
   - PCLK     =  36.0 MHz
   - CPU      =  72.4 MHz
   - UART     =  24.0 MHz

 - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

NUC501 SPI ROM:   - Runs from SPI FLASH.
                  - Code is stored in SPI Flash and Startup 
                    is copied from the Bootloader to SRAM.

NUC501 ROM:       - Runs from SRAM.
                  - Code is stored in SPI Flash and copied 
                    from the Bootloader to SRAM.

NUC501 SRAM:      - Runs from SRAM.
