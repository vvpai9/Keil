This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN. The LEDs show the DHCP phase.
  red LED blinking                : DHCP running
  red LED off, green led blinking : DHCP successful
  red LED off, yellow led blinking: DHCP failed 
                                    (configured IP addressed is used)

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, run your internet browser and type in
the name of this board 'STR9' in the address line.

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

STR9 Dongle:      Standalone application for Keil MCB-STR9 Board.
                  Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STR9 Dongle RTX:  The same example configured for RTX Kernel.

This pre-compiled version is configured "Stand alone" and may be downloaded
using a evalution version of the RealView MDK-ARM package 
(available at www.keil.com/demo).
