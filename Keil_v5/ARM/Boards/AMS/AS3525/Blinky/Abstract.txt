The Blinky project is a simple program for the AustriaMicroSystems 
(AMS) 'AS3525' using AustriaMicroSystems 'AS3525/AS3527 Application 
Board V3.0' evaluation board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - PLLA = (XTAL*2)/(48*1) = 384.00 MHz
   - FCLK = PLLA/6          =  64.00 MHz
   - MPMCCLK = FCLK/3       =  21.33 MHz
   - PCLK = MPMCCLK/1       =  21.33 MHz
 - 2 LEDs (D1 and D2) blink from left to right and back
 
The Blinky program is available for target:
  AS3525 Int RAM:          configured for on-chip RAM
                           (may be used for target debugging)
  AS3525 Ext M25P40 Flash: downloads to External SPI ST M25P40 
                           Flash and runs from Internal RAM
                           (used for production or target debugging)
  AS3525 Ext SDRAM:        configured for external SDRAM 
                           (may be used for target debugging)

Note: To use target 'AS3525 Ext M25P40 Flash', Boot - Selector 
      (DIP switch U21) has to be set to position: 1-ON, 2-OFF, 
      3-OFF, 4-OFF to enable booting from External SPI ST M25P40 
      Flash
