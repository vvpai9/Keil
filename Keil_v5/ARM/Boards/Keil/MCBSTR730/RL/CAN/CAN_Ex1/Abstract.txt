This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'HITEX STR730 Evaluation Board' with 
'ST STR730' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 2 controller (CAN_2 header on board) every 1 second
 - display received byte on CAN 1 controller (CAN_1 header 
   on board) in hexadecimal representation on two 7-segment 
   LED displays
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the value on 7-segment LED displays change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
STR730 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - To see the example functionality on hardware, loopback has 
    to be connected between CAN_1 and CAN_2 (pins 7 on both DB-9 
    headers shorted, and pins 2 on both DB-9 headers shorted)
  - CAN 1 controller is really CAN0 in chip documentation
  - CAN 2 controller is really CAN1 in chip documentation
