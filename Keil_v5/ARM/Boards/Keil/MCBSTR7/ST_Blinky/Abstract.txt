The Blinky project is a simple program for the ST710FZ2T6
using Hitex ST Microelectronics STR7 Evaluation Board
(uses ST Library IRQ Handlers).

It blinks 8 LEDs and prints "Hello World" to the Serial port.

The Hello program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:              configured for software Simulator
  STR7 Eval Board Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  STR7 Eval Board RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                          (may be used for target debugging)
