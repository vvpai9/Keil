The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTR7 Board
using a ST ST STR71x Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs		   (P2.08 .. P2.15)
  - 2 Push Buttons (S2,S3)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTR7: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)
