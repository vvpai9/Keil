This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCBSTR7 Evaluation Board' with 
'ST STR710' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - set converted analog value in first byte in CAN message 
   that will be automatically sent 
   upon reception of REMOTE TRANSMISSION REQUEST
   message, set every 1 second
 - display analog value that will be set, in hexadecimal 
   representation on 8 LEDs
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the value on LEDs and LCD display change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
STR710 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)
