This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

You need to configure the IP address, net mask and default gateway 
and Primary DNS and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c 
configuration file. 

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

This example is configured for a serial PPP connection. You need
to create a dial-up connection on your PC. Select a modem type 
'Communication cable between two computers'. Serial connection speed 
is 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control.
Connect a serial cable to RS232-B port of evaluation board 
and start a dial-up connection with:

Username: Keil
Password: test

Open your web browser and enter the IP address http://192.168.125.1
in the address line.

User name: admin
Password:  <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

MCBSTR7:       Keil MCBSTR7 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCBSTR7 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to RS232-A port to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


NOTE: You have to populate R41 (0 Ohm) short jumper to make a loopback
      required for a PC COM interface to work (solder pads located near
      X44 RS232-B connector)
