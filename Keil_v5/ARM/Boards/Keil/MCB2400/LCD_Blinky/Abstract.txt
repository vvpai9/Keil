The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC2468' 
microcontroller using MCB2400 Evaluation Board.

- Displays rotating ARM 3D logo


The LCD_Blinky program is available for target:
  MCB2400: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
          (used for production or target debugging)

Notes: - Jumper positions:
           - PSX   - H
           - DTX1  - H
           - DTX2  - L
           - BWS0  - H
           - BWS1  - does not matter
           - BWS2  - does not matter
           - CS    - CS2
           - RST   - RST
           - RS    - A1
           - WR/RW - WE
           - P0.15 - closed
           - P0.17 - closed
           - P0.18 - closed
           - P2.13 - does not matter
           
       - QVGA (320xRGBx240) TFT LCD V2.x is used 

       - In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as 
         this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation

Picture conversion procedure:
1. Convert picture to 16 BPP (R - 5bits, G - 6bits, B - 5bits)
2. Convert prepared file without header to C array
