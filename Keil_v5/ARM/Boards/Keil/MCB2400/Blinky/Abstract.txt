The Blinky project is a simple program for the LPC2468
using Embedded Artists boards:
  Daughter Board - 'LPC2468 OEM Board v1.1'
  Mother   Board - 'OEM Base Board Basic v1.1'
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  72 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  18 MHz
 - UART1 settings
   (baudrate = 9600, 8 data bits, 1 stop bits, no parity)
 - Timer0 timer is activating clock_1s every 1 second, 
   starting AD conversion on channel 0 
   (every 1 ms), it works in interrupt mode
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD value of channel 0 is sent every 1 second on UART1
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed depending on AD value of channel 0
   (LEDs are connected through I2C LED Dimmer (PCA9532))
 - SDRAM and NOR flash interfaces are initialized
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:             configured for software Simulator
  LPC2468 Flash:         runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                         (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC2468 Ext SDRAM:     configured for External SDRAM 
                         (used for target debugging)
  LPC2468 Ext NOR Flash: configured for download to 
                         External NOR Flash (SST39VF320)
                         (used for target debugging)

Note: Application for External NOR Flash can not run as 
      standalone as LPC2468 can not boot from External NOR Flash
