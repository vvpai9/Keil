This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory.

The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

MCB2400 Flash:
           Standalone application for Keil MCB2400 Board using
           COM1 port as a communication interface..

           Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART1 port using
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
           1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

MCB2400 Flash RT_Agent:
           Standalone application for Keil MCB2400 Board using
           RT Agent as a communication interface. You can test
           it only with ULINK2 from uVision debugger.

Note:   MCB2400 Base Board Jumper settings:
           
           - Jumper P2.12<->NAND_RDY must be connected
