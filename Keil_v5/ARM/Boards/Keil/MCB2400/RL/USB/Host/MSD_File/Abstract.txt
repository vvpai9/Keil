This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - PLL    = 288 MHz
   - CCLK   =  48 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

MCB2400:   Standalone application for Keil MCB2400 Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

MCB2400 RT_Agent:
           Standalone application for Keil MCB2400 Board using
           RT Agent as a communication interface. You can test
           it only with ULINK2 from uVision debugger.

         - J41 = "P0.13"          -> 1-2 shorted
                 "P0.12"          -> 3-4 shorted
                 "P1.31"          -> 5-6 shorted
         - J42 = "P0.14"          -> 2-3 shorted
         - J44 = "P1.30"          -> 2-3 shorted
         - J45 = "USB-B-"         -> 2-3 shorted
         - J46 = "USB-B+"         -> 2-3 shorted
         - J48 = "VBUS to P1.30"  -> 1-2 shorted (inv.   - for chip Rev. '-')
                                     2-3 shorted (normal - for chip Rev. 'A', 'B', 'D')
