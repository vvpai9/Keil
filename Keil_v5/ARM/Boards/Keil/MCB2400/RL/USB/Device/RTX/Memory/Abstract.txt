The Memory project is a demo program for the Embedded Artists 
LPC2468 Board with a LPC2468 Microcontroller.
 (Daughter Board - 'LPC2468 OEM Board v2.0')
 (Mother   Board - 'OEM Base Board Basic v1.3')

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB2400 RTX: configured for on-chip Flash ROM - RTX version
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J42, J43, J45, J46 to [1 2]3 
     (select USB Device)
