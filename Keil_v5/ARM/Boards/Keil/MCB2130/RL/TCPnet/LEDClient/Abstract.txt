This program is a LEDSwitch Client example. It is used to send commands
to a LEDSwitch Server connected on COM1 over a PPP link. The sending 
commands control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are switched on 
or off. 

To test this example, connect two MCB2130 boards with a null-modem
cable on COM1 ports. Load LEDSwitch server on one MCB2130 board and 
Client application on another Keil MCB2130 board. The Client application 
sends the value of P2 to LEDSwitch application over TCP or UDP.

The Client example is available for several targets:

MCB2130:       Standalone application for Keil MCB2130 Board.
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCB2130 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM0 port to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 19200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

Note: PPP link conects at 19200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
