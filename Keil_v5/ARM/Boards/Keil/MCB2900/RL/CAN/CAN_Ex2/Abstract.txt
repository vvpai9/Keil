This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB2900 Evaluation Board' with 
'NXP LPC2919' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - set converted analog value in first byte in CAN message 
   that will automatically be sent upon reception of REMOTE
   TRANSMISSION REQUEST message on CAN 1 controller
 - send REMOTE TRANSMISSION REQUEST message on CAN 2
   controller, every 1 second
 - display set and received response to REMOTE TRANSMISSION
   REQUEST message on LCD display
 - show number of set messages as a binary value on LEDs 
   P1.24 .. P1.27, and show number of received messages 
   as a binary value on LEDs P1.28 .. P1.31
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
LPC2919 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - To see the example functionality on hardware, loopback has 
    to be connected between CAN1 and CAN2 (pins 7 on both DB-9 
    headers shorted, and pins 2 on both DB-9 headers shorted)
