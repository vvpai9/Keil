The BlinkyCAN project is a simple program for the 'LPC2919' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB2900' evaluation board which
demonstrates I/O, A/D, UART, CAN and Interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             =  10 MHz
   - PLL              = 160 MHz
   - SYS   = PLL / 2  =  80 MHz
   - TMR   = PLL / 2  =  80 MHz
   - FDIV0 = PLL / 40 =   4 MHz
   - ADC   = FDIV0    =   4 MHz
 - Timer 0 is used for generating 10ms time base,
   it works in interrupt mode
 - ADC2 (IN0) is used for getting AD value from 
   potentiometer POT1, it works in interrupt mode
 - LED P1.24..28 show scaled AD value
 - LED P1.29 blinks each second
 - LED P1.30 shows inverted state of S1 button
 - LED P1.31 shows inverted state of S2 button
 - 8-bit counter value is incremented and transmitted
   over CAN0 every 1 second (and displayed on LCD)
 - Received value over CAN0 is also displayed on LCD
 - AD value is sent over UART0 every 1 second
   UART settings: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
                  no parity
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:        configured for software Simulator
  LPC2919 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

Note: CAN0 is used in Loopback mode.
It can be also used to connect two boards via CAN0
(comment CAN_LOOPBACK definition in Blinky.c)
