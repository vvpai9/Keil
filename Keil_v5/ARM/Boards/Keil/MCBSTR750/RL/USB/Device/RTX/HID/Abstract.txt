The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTR750 Board 
using a ST STR750FV2 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (P2.00..07)
  - 2 Push Buttons (P1.13, P1.15)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTR750 RTX: configured for on-chip Flash ROM - RTX version
                (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
