The Virtual COM port project is a demo program for the LPC2378
using Keil MCB2300 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Virtual COM port based on a Windows USB host 
driver (usbser.sys).

The PC will install a virtual COM port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCB2300 USB VCom Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
   
Testing the USB Virtual COM port with serial cable:

  Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
      One with "MCB2300 USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
      One with "Communications Port (COM1)".
  Connect PC port COM1 to MCB2300 COM1 and open "COM1" and "COMx".
  Data from COM1 will be echoed on "COMx" and visa versa. 
  So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM
  port 1 on MCB2300 and the virtual COM port COMx on host PC.    

The Virtual COM Port program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2300: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J5 to 1[2 3] (jumper towards JTAG connector)
      for USB soft connect


Driver Files:
-------------
	- mcb2300-vcom.inf       : Driver setup information.
	- mcb2300-vcom_x86.cat   : Digitally signed driver catalog file for
                               32-bit host PCs.
	- mcb2300-vcom_amd64.cat : Digitally signed driver catalog file for
							   64-bit host PCs.

Note : Digitally signing of the driver catalog file is required to install
drivers on 64-bit PCs using Windows Vista or later Windows versions. Please
refer to Microsoft documentation for further information.
