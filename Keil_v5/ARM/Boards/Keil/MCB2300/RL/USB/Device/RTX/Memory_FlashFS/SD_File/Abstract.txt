The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2300
Board using LPC23xx Microcontroller.

Example functionality:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
    - PLL                    = 288 MHz
    - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
    - USB clock              =  48 MHz
    - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When INT0 button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing INT0 button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port using HyperTerminal
at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.


The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

    Standalone application for MCBSTM2300 Board using RTX kernel
    and serial port as communication interface
    
Note: 
  for Vers.3 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper J1 (D-) on 
    - jumper J2 (D+) on
  for Vers.4 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper D- to [1 2]3 
    - jumper D+ to [1 2]3
