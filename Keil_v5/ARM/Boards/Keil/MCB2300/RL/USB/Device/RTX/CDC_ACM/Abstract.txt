The Virtual COM Port project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2300 Board 
using a NXP LPC23xx Microcontroller.
It demonstrates a bridge between USB USB Virtual COM port and UART port on the 
evaluation board and is based on a Windows USB host driver (usbser.sys).

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCB2300 USB VCom Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
   
Testing the USB Virtual COM Port with serial cable:

  Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
      One with "MCB2300 USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
      One with "Communications Port (COM1)".
  Connect PC port COM1 to MCB2300 COM1 and open "COM1" and "COMx".
  Data from "COM1" will be echoed on "COMx" and visa versa. 
  So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM 
  port 1 on MCB2300 and the Virtual COM Port COMx on host PC.    

The Virtual COM Port program is available for the following target:
  MCB2300:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note: 
  for Vers.3 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper J1 (D-) on 
    - jumper J2 (D+) on
  for Vers.4 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper D- to [1 2]3 
    - jumper D+ to [1 2]3
Important Note: MCB2300 does not have routed flow control pins on the UART 
                so it is possible that this example will loose characters 
                because of lack of flow control

Note : Digitally signing of the driver catalog file is required to install
drivers on 64-bit PCs using Windows Vista or later Windows versions. Please
refer to Microsoft documentation for further information.
