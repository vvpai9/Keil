The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2300 Board 
using a NXP LPC23xx Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (LED0..7)
  - 1 Push Button (INT0)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCB2300:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note:
  for Vers.3 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper J1 (D-) on 
    - jumper J2 (D+) on
  for Vers.4 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper D- to [1 2]3 
    - jumper D+ to [1 2]3
