This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - PLL    = 288 MHz
   - CCLK   =  48 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard as terminal input to 
the device and it uses UART as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCB2300:   Standalone application for Keil MCB2300 Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

Note: 
    - set jumper D- to 1[2 3] 
    - set jumper D+ to 1[2 3]
