This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - PLL    = 288 MHz
   - CCLK   =  48 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

MCB2300:   Standalone application for Keil MCB2300 Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

MCB2300 RT_Agent:
           Standalone application for Keil MCB2300 Board using
           RT Agent as a communication interface. You can test
           it only with ULINK2 from uVision debugger.

Note: 
    - set jumper D- to 1[2 3] 
    - set jumper D+ to 1[2 3]
