This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect MCB2300 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect MCB2300 Board
to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case configure
a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable the
'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c configuration file.
The default static IP address of MCB2300 is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the 
address ftp://mcb2300/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>
