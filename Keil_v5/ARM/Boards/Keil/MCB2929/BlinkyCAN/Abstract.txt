The BlinkyCAN project is a simple program for the 'LPC2929' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB2929' evaluation board which
demonstrates I/O, A/D, UART, CAN and Interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             =  12 MHz
   - PLL              = 192 MHz
   - SYS   = PLL / 2  =  96 MHz
   - TMR   = PLL / 2  =  96 MHz
   - FDIV0 = PLL / 48 =   4 MHz
   - ADC   = FDIV0    =   4 MHz
 - Timer 0 is used for generating 10ms time base,
   it works in interrupt mode
 - "ADC0 (IN0)" / "ADC2 (IN0)" is used for getting AD value from 
   potentiometer POT1, it works in interrupt mode.
   (ADC0 is selected as default.)
 - LED P2.16..20 show scaled AD value
 - LED P2.21 blinks each second
 - LED P2.22 shows inverted state of S1 button
 - LED P2.23 shows inverted state of S2 button
 - 8-bit counter value is incremented and transmitted
   over CAN0 every 1 second (and displayed on graphic LCD)
 - Received value over CAN0 is also displayed on graphic LCD

 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MCB2929:          runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

Note: CAN0 is used in Loopback mode.
It can be also used to connect two boards via CAN0
(comment CAN_LOOPBACK definition in Blinky.c)
