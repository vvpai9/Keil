This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB2929 Evaluation Board' with 
'NXP LPC2929' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - send converted AD value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 2 controller every 1 second
  - "ADC0 (IN0)" / "ADC2 (IN0)" is used for getting AD value from 
   potentiometer POT1, it works in interrupt mode.
   (ADC0 is selected as default.)
 - receive CAN message on CAN 1 controller
 - display transmitted and received values on LCD display
 - show number of sent messages as a binary value on LEDs 
   P2.16 .. P2.19, and show number of received messages 
   as a binary value on LEDs P2.20 .. P2.23
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

MCB2929:   NXP LPC2929 internal Flash

Notes:      
  - To see the example functionality on hardware, loopback has 
    to be connected between CAN1 and CAN2 (pins 7 on both DB-9 
    headers shorted, and pins 2 on both DB-9 headers shorted)
