The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2900 Board 
using a NXP LPC2929 Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 196 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB2900    : configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J7 to 1[2 3] (jumper towards JTAG connector)
      for USB soft connect
