The Blinky project is a simple program for the 'LPC2929' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB2900' evaluation board 
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             =  12 MHz
   - PLL              = 192 MHz
   - SYS   = PLL / 2  =  96 MHz
   - TMR   = PLL / 2  =  96 MHz
   - FDIV0 = PLL / 48 =   4 MHz
   - ADC   = FDIV0    =   4 MHz
 - 8 LEDs blink from left to right and back
   (LEDs are connected to P2.16 .. P2.23)
 - speed of LED blinking can be changed by pressing 
   S1 (increased) or S2 (decreased) buttons
   (S1 - P2.26; S2 - P2.27)
 - Timer 0 is used for generating time for LED
   blinking, it works in interrupt mode
 - "ADC0 (IN0)" / "ADC2 (IN0)" is used for getting AD value from 
   potentiometer POT1, it works in interrupt mode.
   (ADC0 is selected as default.)
 - Outputs AD value on UART0 every 1 second
   UART settings: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, 
                  no parity
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MCB2929      : runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
