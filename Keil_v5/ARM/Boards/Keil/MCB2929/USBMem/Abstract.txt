The Memory project is a demo program for the LPC2929
using Keil MCB2929 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 196 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - P2.16: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - P2.17: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - P2.20: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - P2.21: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2929         : configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                  (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J7 to 1[2 3] (jumper towards JTAG connector)
      for USB soft connect
