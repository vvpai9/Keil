The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the TI 'TMS570' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMS570' 
evaluation board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  16 MHz
   - CCLK  = 160 MHz

 - 5 LEDs blink simulating Half step-motor driver.

The Blinky program is available for one target:
  MCBTMS570: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)
