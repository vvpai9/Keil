The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the TI 'TMS570' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMS570' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  16 MHz
   - CCLK  = 160 MHz

 - 6 LEDs blink with AD Ligth conversion speed
 - AD conversion is done in polling mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value for Temperature and Light are displayed on the GLCD 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TMS570 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)
