This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory.

The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for single target:

LPC2478 Flash:
           Standalone application for Keil MCB2470 Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

           Connect a USB cable to UART0 to USB Bridge using
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
           1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Note:   MCB2400 Base Board Jumper settings:
           
           - Jumper P2.21<->NAND_RDY must be connected
