using a NXP LPC214x Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  60 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Audio Device - Speaker.

The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Audio driver and add a
speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.
Potentiometer on the board is used for setting the Volume
and the LEDs are used to display a simplified VU Meter.

The Audio program is available for the following target:
