The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2140 Board 
using a NXP LPC214x Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  60 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB2140:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)
