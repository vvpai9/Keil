This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

This example is configured for a serial PPP connection. You need
to create a dial-up connection on your PC. Select a modem type 
'Communication cable between two computers'. Serial connection speed 
is 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control.
Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port of evaluation board 
and start a dial-up connection with:

Username: Keil
Password: test

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the 
address ftp://192.168.125.1 or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

MCB2140:       Standalone application for Keil MCB2140 Board.
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCB2140 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM0 port to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

NOTE: Serial interface uses only TXD, RXD and GND signals from the 
      RS232 line. However in most cases some additional connections
      are required by the PC COM interface. For a 9-PIN standard
      connector you should therefore connect the pin 7 (RTS) to
      pin 8 (CTS) and pin 1 (CD) to pin 4 (DTR) and to pin 6 (DSR).
