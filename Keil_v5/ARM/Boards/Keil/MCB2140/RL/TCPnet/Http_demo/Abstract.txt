This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

You need to configure the IP address, net mask and default gateway 
and Primary DNS and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c 
configuration file. 

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

This example is configured for a serial PPP connection. You need
to create a dial-up connection on your PC. Select a modem type 
'Communication cable between two computers'. Serial connection speed 
is 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control.
Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port of evaluation board 
and start a dial-up connection with:

Username: Keil
Password: test

Open your web browser and enter the IP address http://192.168.125.1
in the address line.

User name: admin
Password:  <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

MCB2140:       Keil MCB2130 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCB2140 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM0 port to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


NOTE: Serial interface uses only TXD, RXD and GND signals from the 
      RS232 line. However in most cases some additional connections
      are required by the PC COM interface. For a 9-PIN standard
      connector you should therefore connect the pin 7 (RTS) to
      pin 8 (CTS) and pin 1 (CD) to pin 4 (DTR) and to pin 6 (DSR).
