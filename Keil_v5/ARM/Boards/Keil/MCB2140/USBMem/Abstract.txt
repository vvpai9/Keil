The Memory project is a demo program for the LPC2148 
using Keil MCB2140 Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  60 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - P1.16: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - P1.17: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - P1.22: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - P1.23: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2140: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)
