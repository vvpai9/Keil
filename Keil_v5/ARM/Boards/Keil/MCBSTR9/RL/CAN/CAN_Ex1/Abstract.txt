This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB-STR9 Evaluation Board' with 
'ST STR910' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN controller every 1 second
 - display received byte on CAN controller in hexadecimal 
   representation on 8 LEDs
 - display received and transmitted byte values 
   on LCD display
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the value on LEDs and LCD display change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
STR910 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - to use this example on real CAN network remove 
    CAN_EnterTestMode line from CAN_Ex1.c file
