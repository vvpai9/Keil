This program is a BSD Client example. It is used to send commands
to a BSD_server or LEDSwitch server connected on the same LAN. The 
sending commands control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are
switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run BSD_server or LEDSwitch server on eval board
and Client application on another eval board connected on the same LAN. 
The Client sends the value of P2 to BSD_server over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The BSD_client example is available for several targets:

MCBSTR9:        Standalone application for Keil MCBSTR9 Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCBSTR9 Debug:  Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM2 port to view
                output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
                8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
