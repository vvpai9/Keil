The Blinky project is a simple program for the LPC2103
using Silica 'SILICA-LPC2103' Board.

It displays scrolling text on LED matrix and outputs 
text to the Serial Port 1 (UART1 at 19200 baud, 8 data bits, 
1 stop bit, no parity).
The scrolling direction can be changed by pressing 
BUT1 button and intensity of LEDs can be changed by pressing 
the BUT2 button.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in software Simulator
  MCB2103 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for final aplication version)
