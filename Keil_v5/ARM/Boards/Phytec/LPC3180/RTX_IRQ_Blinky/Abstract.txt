This is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the 
NXP LPC3180 using PHYTEC 'PCM-976' with 'PCM-03' Board
which simulates the step-motor driver and demonstrates 
interrupt functionality. 
Three LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the three output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C

One LED blinks depending on setting of millisecond timer.

Clocks: Oscillator                   =  13.00 MHz
        HCLK_PLL   = Oscillator * 16 = 208.00 MHz
        Processor  = HCLK_PLL        = 208.00 MHz
        HCLK       = HCLK_PLL / 2    = 104.00 MHz
        PERIPH_CLK = HCLK_PLL / 16   =  13.00 MHz

The BLINKY example program is available for target:

LPC3180 Ext SDRAM: Phytec LPC3180 evaluation board 
                   with ULINK debugger

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
       (from Keil) to NAND Flash 
    2. Download application to NAND Flash
