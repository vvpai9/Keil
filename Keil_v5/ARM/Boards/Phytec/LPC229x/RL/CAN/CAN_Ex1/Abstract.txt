This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Phytec phyCORE LPC229x Evaluation Board' with 
'NXP LPC2294' microcontroller.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL  =  10 MHz
 - PLL   = 240 MHz
 - CCLK  =  60 MHz

Example functionality:
 - send incrementing byte value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 2 controller every 1 second
 - display lowest bit of received byte on CAN 1 controller 
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:         configured for software Simulator
LPC229x Ext Flash: runs from External Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - For CAN signals to be routed out to P2 DB-9 connectors 
    jumpers have to be set as according:
    JP31: 2-3, JP32: 2-3, JP33: 2-4, JP34: 2-3
    (for detail on jumper settings see picture Board.png 
     that can be found in this example root folder)
  - CAN1 is on P2A (lower)  DB-9 connector 
    CAN2 is on P2B (higher) DB-9 connector
  - To see the example functionality on hardware, loopback has 
    to be connected between CAN1 and CAN2 (pins 7 on both DB-9 
    connectors shorted, and pins 2 on both DB-9 connectors 
    shorted)
