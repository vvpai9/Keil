This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

Use this example to connect LPC229x Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect LPC229x Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, run your internet browser and type in
the name of this board 'phycore' in the address line.

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC229x:       Standalone application for Phytec LPC229x Board. 
               Program code is loaded into off-chip flash

LPC229x Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to COM0 to view output messages
               using HyperTerminal at 19200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
               1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC229x RTX:   The same example configured for RTX Kernel.

Note: To use BOOT Push Button as a digital input, jumper JP28
      must be set to the following position: 3 + 4 and 6 + 8
