This program is a TFTP Server example. It shows how to use a 
Trivial File Transfer Protocol to send files to and receive 
files from an evaluation board. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available 
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway manually in
the Net_Config.c configuration file. You have to disable also
'Dynamic Host Configuration' under the 'Ethernet Network 
Interface' section.

This example is configured to run in 3 simultaneous sessions.
This means that 3 TFTP Clients can be connected to TFTP Server
at the same time. This can be either 3 different PC computers or a
single PC computer running 3 instances of TFTP Client. 

To test this example you need to run a TFTP client on your PC.
If you do not have installed a special TFTP Client software on your
PC, you can run the Windows tftp client from a Console Window.

To send a file to TFTP Server from the console window:
  tftp phycore put [file.ext]

To receive a file from TFTP Server from the console window:
  tftp phycore get [file.ext]

Flash File System running from SRAM is used as the file system.
It is configured for total capacity of 1 MByte.

The TFTP_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC229x:       Standalone application for Phytec LPC229x Board. 
               Program code is loaded into off-chip flash

LPC229x Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to COM0 to view output messages
               using HyperTerminal at 19200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
               1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
