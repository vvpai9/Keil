This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory. 

The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
off-chip flash and available for one target:

LPC3250:   Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
           configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
           external NOR flash. This example uses COM5 
           (bottom conn.) as a communication interface.
 
           Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM5 port using
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
           1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
