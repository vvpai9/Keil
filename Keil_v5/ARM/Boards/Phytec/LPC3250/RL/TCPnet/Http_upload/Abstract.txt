This is a HTTP File Upload example. It allows you to upload
files to SD Card from a Web browser.

Use this example to connect LPC3250 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect LPC3250 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the 
address http://lpc3250/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The HTTP_upload example is available for one target:

LPC3250:       Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
               configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
               external NOR flash. 

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level NOR bootloader
       ('bootloader_NOR' from Keil) to external NOR flash 
    2. Download this application to external NOR Flash
