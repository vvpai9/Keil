This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC3250:       Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
               configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
               external NOR flash. 


LPC3250 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to COM5 (bottom conn.) to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level NOR bootloader
       ('bootloader_NOR' from Keil) to external NOR flash 
    2. Download this application to external NOR Flash
