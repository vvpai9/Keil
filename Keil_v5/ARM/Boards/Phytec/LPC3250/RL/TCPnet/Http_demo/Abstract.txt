This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

Use this example to connect LPC3250 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect LPC3250 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, run your internet browser and type in
the name of this board 'lpc3250' in the address line.

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC3250:       Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
               configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
               external NOR flash. 


LPC3250 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to COM5 (bottom conn.) to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC3250 RTX:   The same example configured for RTX Kernel.

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level NOR bootloader
       ('bootloader_NOR' from Keil) to external NOR flash 
    2. Download this application to external NOR Flash
