This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                      =  13.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK                    =  13.00 MHz
   - HCLKPLL                   = 208.00 MHz
   - USBPLL                    =  48.00 MHz
   - ARM_CLK    = HCLKPLL      = 208.00 MHz
   - HCLK       = HCLKPLL / 2  = 104.00 MHz
   - USBCLK     = USBPLL       =  48.00 MHz
   - PERIPH_CLK = HCLKPLL / 16 =  13.00 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART5: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
off-chip NOR flash and available for one target:

Phytec LPC3250: Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
           configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
           external NOR flash. This example uses COM 
           (bottom conn.) as a communication interface.

Notes: for standalone application (NOR, NAND) you have to:
        1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
           (from Keil) to appropriate external flash 
        2. Download application built for 'Ext SDRAM' 
           target to appropriate Flash
