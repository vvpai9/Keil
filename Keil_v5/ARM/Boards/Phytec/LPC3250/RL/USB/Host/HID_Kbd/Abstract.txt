This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                      =  13.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK                    =  13.00 MHz
   - HCLKPLL                   = 208.00 MHz
   - USBPLL                    =  48.00 MHz
   - ARM_CLK    = HCLKPLL      = 208.00 MHz
   - HCLK       = HCLKPLL / 2  = 104.00 MHz
   - USBCLK     = USBPLL       =  48.00 MHz
   - PERIPH_CLK = HCLKPLL / 16 =  13.00 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART5: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard as terminal input to 
the device and it uses UART as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

Phytec LPC3250: Standalone application for Phytec LPC3250 board,
           configured to run in external SDRAM and loaded to
           external NOR flash. This example uses COM 
           (bottom conn.) as a communication interface.

Notes: for standalone application (NOR, NAND) you have to:
        1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
           (from Keil) to appropriate external flash 
        2. Download application built for 'Ext SDRAM' 
           target to appropriate Flash
