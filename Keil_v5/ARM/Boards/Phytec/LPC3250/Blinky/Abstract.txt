The Blinky project is an simple example program for the  
LPC3250 using PHYTEC 'PCM-967' with 'PCM-1304.0' Board.

Example functionality:
 - 2 LEDs blink (LED1, LED2)

Clocks: XTAL                      =  13.00 MHz, 
        SYSCLK                    =  13.00 MHz, 
        HCLKPLL                   = 208.00 MHz, 
        ARM_CLK    = HCLKPLL      = 208.00 MHz
        HCLK       = HCLKPLL / 2  = 104.00 MHz
        PERIPH_CLK = HCLKPLL / 16 =  13.00 MHz

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  LPC3250 Int RAM:          configured for on-chip RAM
              (may be used for target debugging)
  LPC3250 Ext SDRAM (NOR):  configured to run in external 
              SDRAM and loaded to external NOR flash
              (may be used for target debugging or production)
  LPC3250 Ext SDRAM (NAND): configured to run in external 
              SDRAM and loaded to external NAND flash
              (may be used for target debugging or production)

Notes: 
  - for standalone application (NOR, NAND) you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
       (from Keil) to appropriate external flash 
    2. Download application built for 'Ext SDRAM' 
       target to appropriate Flash
