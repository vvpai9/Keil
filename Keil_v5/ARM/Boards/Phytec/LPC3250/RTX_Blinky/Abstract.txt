This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which blinks
two LEDs on the Phytec LPC3250 evaluation board 
using PHYTEC 'PCM-967' and 'PCM-1304.0' Boards.

Clocks: Oscillator                   =  13.00 MHz
        HCLK_PLL   = Oscillator * 16 = 208.00 MHz
        Processor  = HCLK_PLL        = 208.00 MHz
        HCLK       = HCLK_PLL / 2    = 104.00 MHz
        PERIPH_CLK = HCLK_PLL / 16   =  13.00 MHz

The RTX_BLINKY project is set up for one target:
  LPC3250 Ext SDRAM:  configured to run in external SDRAM 
                      and loaded to external NOR flash

Notes: 
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level NOR bootloader
       ('bootloader_NOR' from Keil) to external NOR flash 
    2. Download the application to external NOR Flash
