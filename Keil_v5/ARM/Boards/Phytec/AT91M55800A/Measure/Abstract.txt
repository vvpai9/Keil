The MEASURE program uses the analog inputs of the AT91M55800A
to simulate a datalogger.  This example shows how you can use
signal functions in dScope to simulate a signal coming into
one of the analog inputs of the AT91M55800A or you can use
this example to run on the Phytec phyCORE AT91M55800A Board.

The MEASURE program is available in different targets:
  Simulator AT91M55800A: for Software Simulator
  pyhXRAM   AT91M55800A: for phyCORE Board (XRAM)
  pyhFlash  AT91M55800A: for phyCORE Board (Flash)
