The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ROHM 'BU1511KV2' 
microcontroller using ROHM BU1511KV2 Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL     =  13.5 MHz
   - PLL0     =  81.0 MHz
   - SysCCLK  =  40.5 MHz

 - USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  Ext. Flash:    runs from external Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  Ext. RAM:      runs from external RAM
                 (TCM Cache needs to be enabled before)

  TCM Cache:     runs I-TCM cache
                 (TCM Cache needs to be enabled before)
