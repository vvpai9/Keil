This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which toggles port
pin GPIO0 and prints message on USART2 serial port.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL     =  13.5 MHz
   - PLL0     =  81.0 MHz
   - SysCCLK  =  40.5 MHz

 - USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The RTX_Blinky program is available for one target:
  BU1511KV2-EB:  runs from external Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)
