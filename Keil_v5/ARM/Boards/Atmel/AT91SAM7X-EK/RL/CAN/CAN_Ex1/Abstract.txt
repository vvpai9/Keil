This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Atmel AT91SAM7X-EK Evaluation Board' with 
'Atmel AT91SAM7X256' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - send joystick position in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 1 controller every 1 second
   (UP = bit 0, DOWN = bit 1, LEFT = bit 2, RIGHT = bit 3)
 - display higher 4 bits of received byte on CAN 1 controller 
   in hexadecimal representation on 4 LEDs
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate input pins in uVision.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:    configured for software Simulator
SAM7X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:
  - As this microcontroller only has only one CAN controller 
    the example is not demonstrative by itself, to be able to 
    see whole functionality another device that sends or 
    receives CAN messages is necessary
