This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from on-board
Atmel AT45DB321C or AT45DB642D SPI Data Flash.

The SPI_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

AT91SAM7X-321:
        Standalone application for Atmel AT91SAM7X-EK evaluation
        Board using RS232 COM port as a communication interface.
        The board is populated with AT45DB321C SPI flash.

AT91SAM7X-642:
        Standalone application for Atmel AT91SAM7X-EK evaluation
        Board using RS232 COM port as a communication interface.
        The board is populated with AT45DB642D SPI flash.


        Connect a serial null-modem cable to RS232 COM1 port 
        using a HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
        1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

Note: Jumper settings are:
        J19 - ON  (SPI_NPCS0)
        S3  - OFF (Write protect)
