The HID project is a demo program for the Atmel AT91SAM7A3-EK Board 
using a Atmel AT91SAM7A3 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs (DS1..4)
  - 5 Push Buttons (Joystick: Left, Right, Up, Down and Push)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  SAM7A3-EK:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)
