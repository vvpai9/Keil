This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

AT91SAM7SE: Atmel AT91SAM7SE evaluation board with ULINK debugger
            - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
