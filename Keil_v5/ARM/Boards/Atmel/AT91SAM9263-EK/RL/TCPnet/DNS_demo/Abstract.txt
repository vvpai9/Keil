This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

AT91SAM9263: Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application, configured
             for external SDRAM (64MB), downloaded to external
             DataFlash (8.25MB).

AT91SAM9263 Debug:
             Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output, configured
             for external SDRAM, downloaded to external DataFlash.
             Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
             Connect a serial cable to SERIAL DEBUG port to view
             output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
             8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
