This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card.

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
external DataFlash debugged in external SDRAM and available 
for one target:

AT91SAM9263: Standalone application for Atmel AT91SAM9263-EK evaluation.
             Configured for external SDRAM (64MB), downloaded to external
             DataFlash (8.25MB).

             DEBUG PORT is used as console. Connect a serial null-modem 
             cable to DEBUG PORT. Used port settings are:
             115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Notes: 
  - For "AT91SAM9263" target if Debug is selected the code is loaded to 
    External SDRAM and debugging happens there, if Download to Flash Memory 
    is selected the code downloads to External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "AT91SAM9263" version 
    to work as standalone. This is done by opening Bootloader project 
    and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" button.
