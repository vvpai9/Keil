The HID project is a demo program for the Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK Board 
using a Atmel AT91SAM7S Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs (DS1..4)
  - 4 Push Button (BP1..4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  SAM7S-EK RTX: configured for on-chip Flash ROM - RTX version
               (used for production or target debugging)
