The Mouse project is a demo program for the Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK Board 
using a Atmel AT91SAM7S Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Mouse based on USB HID.
Since there are only 4 Push Buttons (SW1..4) available
the following is used for Mouse movements and clicks:
  - SW1 (BP1) selects between X (Left/Right) or Y (Up/Down) movement
    and also beetween Left or Right click
  - SW2 (BP2) is used for relative movement 
    Left (SW1 (BP1) not pressed) or Down (SW1 (BP1) pressed)
  - SW3 (BP2) is used for relative movement
    Right (SW1 (BP1) not pressed) or Up (SW1 (BP1) pressed)
  - SW4 (BP4) is used for clicks
    Left (SW1 (BP1) not presed) or Right (SW1 (BP1) pressed)

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED1 (DS1) shows the SW1 (BP1) state

The USB Mouse is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mouse driver.

The Mouse program is available for the following target:
  SAM7S-EK:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)
