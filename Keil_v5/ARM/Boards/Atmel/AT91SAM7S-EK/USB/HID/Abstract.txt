The HID project is a demo program for the AT91SAM7S64
using Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK Microcontroller Board.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs (LED1..4)
  - 4 Push Buttons (SW1..4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  AT91SAM7S-EK: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)
