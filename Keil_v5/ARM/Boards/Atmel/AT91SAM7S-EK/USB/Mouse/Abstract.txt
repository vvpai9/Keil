The Mouse project is a demo program for the AT91SAM7S64
using Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK Microcontroller Board.

    and also beetween Left or Right click
  - SW2 is used for negative movement
    Left (SW1 not pressed) or Up (SW1 pressed)
  - SW3 is used for positive movement
    Right (SW1 not pressed) or Down (SW1 pressed)
  - SW4 is used for clicks
    Left (SW1 not presed) or Right (SW1 pressed)

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED1 shows the SW1 state
  - LED3 is on when USB Device is configured
  - LED4 is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Mouse is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mouse driver.

The Mouse program is available for the following targets:
