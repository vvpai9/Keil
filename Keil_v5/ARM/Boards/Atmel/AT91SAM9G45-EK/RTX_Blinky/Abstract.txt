This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

This example simulates step driver mode.

The Blinky example program is available for target:

AT91SAM9G45: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
             downloaded to external DataFlash (4.125MB)
             AT45D321D (page is 528 bytes)
             (used for target debugging and production)

Notes: 
  - If Debug is selected the code is loaded to External SDRAM 
    and debugging happens there, if Download to Flash Memory 
    is selected the code downloads to External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for this version 
    to work as standalone. This is done by opening Bootloader 
    project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" button.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. Select "AT91SAM9G45" target in this project and 
     click on "Download to Flash Memory" button
 
  3. Remove jumper JP10 on the board

  4. Reset the board
