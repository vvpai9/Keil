This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                        =  12.0 MHz
   - PLLA clock = XTAL * 200 / 3 = 800.0 MHz
   - CPU  clock = PLLA / 2       = 400.0 MHz
   - MCK  clock = CPU Clock / 3  = 133.3 MHz
   - UPLL clock   XTAL * 40      = 480.0 MHz
   - USB  clock = UPLL / 10      =  48.0 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - SERIAL DEBUG PORT: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

AT91SAM9G45: Standalone application for Atmel AT91SAM9M10-G45-EK evaluation.
             Configured for external SDRAM (128MB), downloaded to external
             DataFlash (4.125MB).

Notes: 
  - For "AT91SAM9G45" target if Debug is selected the code is loaded to 
    External SDRAM and debugging happens there, if Download to Flash Memory 
    is selected the code downloads to External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "AT91SAM9G45" version 
    to work as standalone. This is done by opening Bootloader project 
    and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" button.
  - If you experience failure of downloading to flash please remove the 
    SD Card from the SD Card slot during programming

Notes: Remove jumper JP10 to boot from Dataflash
