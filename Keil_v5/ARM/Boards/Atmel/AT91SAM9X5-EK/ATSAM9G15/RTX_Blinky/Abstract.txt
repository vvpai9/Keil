This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

This example simulates step driver mode.

The BLINKY example program is available for target:

AT91SAM9G15: configured for external SDRAM (128MB)
             downloaded to external SerialFlash (4MB)
             (used for target debugging and production)
             AT25D321D (page is 256 bytes)
Notes: 
  - If Debug is selected the code is loaded to External SDRAM 
    and debugging happens there, if Download to Flash Memory 
    is selected the code downloads to External SerialFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for this version 
    to work as standalone. This is done by opening Bootloader 
    project.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. Select "AT91SAM9G15" target in this project and
