This program is a BSD socket Server example. This example opens a 
Stream (TCP) and Datagram (UDP) sockets for listening and waits for 
commands coming from PC Client or another eval-board client. The 
commands are used to control LED diodes to switch them on and off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters 
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run windows application LEDSwitch.exe and enter
the ip address of your Embedded BSD_Server into "Board IP" edit box. 
Enter also the number of transfer port into "Transfer port" edit box. 
Select one of transfer protocol (TCP or UDP). When the P2
value in windows application is changed, this value is sent to 
eval-board and the LED on board should light accordingly.

The same example can be tested also with another eval-board Client 
connected to the same LAN. The BSD_Server is protocol compatible to
LEDSwitch. 

The BSD_Server example is available for several targets:

AT91SAM9260: Standalone application for AT91SAM9260 board, configured
             for external SDRAM (64MB), downloaded to external
             DataFlash (8.25MB).

AT91SAM9260 Debug:
             Standalone with debug output, configured
             for external SDRAM, downloaded to external DataFlash.
             Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
             Connect a serial cable to SERIAL DEBUG port to view
             output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
             8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
