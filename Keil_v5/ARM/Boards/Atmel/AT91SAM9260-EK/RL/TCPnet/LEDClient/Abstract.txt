This program is a LEDSwitch Client example. It is used to send commands
to a LEDSwitch Server connected on the same LAN. The sending commands 
control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run application LEDSwitch on one AT91SAM9260-EK
board and Client application on other Atmel AT91SAM9260-EK board. 
The Client application sends the value of P2 to LEDSwitch 
application over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The Client example is available for several targets:

AT91SAM9260: Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application, configured
             for external SDRAM (64MB), downloaded to external
             DataFlash (8.25MB).

AT91SAM9260 Debug:
             Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output, configured
             for external SDRAM, downloaded to external DataFlash.
             Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
             Connect a serial cable to SERIAL DEBUG port to view
             output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
             8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
